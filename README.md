##R language for Human Performance Analysis.

This repo is for my collaborative solutions for data processing, analysis and reporting. 
The type of data we work with usually seeks for:

- Biological signal processing (filtering, sampling and windowing).
- Data visualization for individual results analysis.
- Report as a pdf file for the client.
